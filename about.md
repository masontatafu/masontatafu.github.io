{: .intro-block}
I'm a recent CIS graduate with hands-on IT support experience, currently based in Melbourne. Iâ€™ve balanced a competitive football career with my studies and workâ€”living independently across the U.S., Croatia, and Australia. I'm now looking for roles where I can keep learning, contribute to a team, and apply both my technical skills and real-world adaptability.


## ðŸŽ¯ Career Goals
{:.about-header}

My goal is to merge my competitive mindset with tech. Iâ€™m working toward a career in software and system development, with interests in cybersecurity, data analysis, and web technologies. Long-term, I want to be part of a team building smart, scalable systems that make a real impact â€” whether thatâ€™s in sports tech, analytics, or something completely unexpected.
